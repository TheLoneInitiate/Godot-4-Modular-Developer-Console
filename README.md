# Modular Developer Console for Godot 4.x

_**A simple and effective in-game console designed for easily adding or removing new console commands. Our modular approach will suit all your needs.**_  
  
**Default toggle key : " ~ "**  
  
The main console script `res://scripts/console.gd` scans a commands folder which holds a separate script file for each individual command. Making it extremely easy to add or remove commands without needing to modify the main console script.

**Here's an example script of the exit command for closing your game**

To add a new command just create a new script file in the /scripts/console/commands/ directory and put your functionality in the func run command.  
It's as simple as that.  
  
Here's a list of already existing commands that come with this project as of now :  
  

 **- rcon_password** **<password>**
Can be used to require additional privilege for specific commands.  
To require password authentication for a command just start the run function with an if statement 
( See Image below )_

# Installation Details

Add extract the addons folder into the root res:// directory.
It will then automatically set the console.tscn as an autoload singleton in your project settings.
To test it, launch your project and use the ` key to open the console.

Make sure the following directory paths exists :
res://addons/ModularDevConsole/logs
res://addons/ModularDevConsole/commands
res://scenes

If you're having issues, make sure to check for capital letters in the directory listings.
all the directories use lowercase letters.


To enable and disable auto save / auto load console logs you will need to edit the boolean in the main console.gd file.
It's all very organized and easy to deal with.
